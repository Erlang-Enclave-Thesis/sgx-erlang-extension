# SGX-Erlang-extension

This work was created in a Master's thesis for Chalmers University and Ericsson AB by Eliot Roxbergh and Emil Hemdal.
It consists of prototypes for calling secure C code from Erlang, including OpenSSL, as well as efforts to execute the whole BEAM runtime itself inside of SGX.
